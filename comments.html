    <h4>Introduction to Javascript</h4>
    <h1>Comments</h1>

    <p>
        Programming is often highly collaborative. In addition, our own code can quickly become <br>
        difficult to understand when we return to it— sometimes only an hour later! For these reasons,<br>
        it’s often useful to leave notes in our code for other developers or ourselves.<br><br>

        As we write JavaScript, we can write comments in our code that the computer will ignore <br>
        as our program runs. These comments exist just for human readers.<br><br>
        Comments can explain what the code is doing, leave instructions for developers using the code, <br>
        or add any other useful annotations.<br><br>

        There are two types of code comments in JavaScript:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>A single line comment will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward <br>
            slashes // preceding it.
        </li>
        <img src="image/comment.PNG" alt="">
        <p>You can also use a single line comment to comment after a line of code:</p>
        <img src="image/comment2.PNG" alt="">

        <br><br>

        <li>
            A multi-line comment will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with /* to begin the comment, and */ to end the comment.
        </li>
        <img src="image/comment3.PNG" alt="">
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use this syntax to comment something out in the middle of a line of code:</p>
    <img src="image/comment4.PNG" alt="">


    <script>
      
        console.log(/*"Apple",*/ 5); //This will ignore the Apple and output only 5
      
    </script>

    <div class="nav-button">
        <button><a href="console.html">BACK</a></button>
        <button><a href="data_types.html">NEXT</a></button>
    </div>
</body>
