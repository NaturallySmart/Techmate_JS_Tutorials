    <h1>Arrays</h1>

    <p>
        Organizing and Storing data is very important in programming. This can be likened to 
        making a list of items. However, in programming, <b>Arrays</b> makes it easy to store
        various items in a single variable. <br><br>

        For instance, let's see we have a list of 5 different type of cars, if declaring them
        using variable, it will look like this: <br>

        <pre>
            let car1 = "Toyota";
            let car2 = "Honda";
            let car3 = "BMW";
            let car4 = "Ford";
            let car5 = "Tesla";
        </pre>

        Now imagine we have over 500 type of cars, you will see that using the above method will
        be curbersome. However, an Array can solve this problem this way:

        <pre>
            let cars = ["Toyota", "Honda", "BMW", "Ford", "Tesla"]; // Declare array

        </pre>

        Arrays are JavaScript’s way of making lists. Arrays can store any data types (including 
        strings, numbers, and booleans). Like lists, arrays are ordered, meaning each item has a 
        numbered position. <br><br>

        Here’s an array of the concepts we’ll cover:

        <pre>
            let concepts = ['creating arrays', 'array structures', 'array 
            manipulation'];  

        </pre>
    </p>
