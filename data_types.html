    <h4>Introduction to Javascript</h4>
    <h1>Data Types</h1>

    <p>
        <em>Data types</em> are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in
        programming. In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><b><em>Number type</em>:</b> This is used for numerical values. It can have decimal or no decimal. 
            For Example: 2, 5. 78, 5.78, 100 etc <br>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b><em>BigInt:</em></b> Any number, greater than 2 <sup>53</sup>-1 or less than -(2 <sup>53</sup>-1), 
            with n appended to the number: 1234567890123456n.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><em>String:</em></b> Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, 
            etc.) surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ",. Some people like to think of 
            string as a fancy word for text. for Example "Hello World", 'Hello' etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><em>boolean:</em></b> true or false values. This is mostly used in statements or as an answer to a 
            YES or No question.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><em>Null:</em></b> This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword
            null (without quotes).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><em>Objects:</em></b> Collection of related information enclosed between curly braces {}.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><em>Undefined:</em></b> This data type is denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes). It also represents the 
            absence of a value though it has a different use than null. undefined means that a given value does not
            exist.
        </li>  
    </ol>
     <br>

    <p>
        They are the most basic data types in the language. Objects are more complex, and you’ll learn much more 
        about them as you progress through JavaScript. At first, seven types may not seem like that many, but soon 
        you’ll observe the world opens with possibilities once you start leveraging each one. As you learn more 
        about objects, you’ll be able to create complex collections of data.

    <script>
        
        console.log('JavaScript'); // This is a string

        console.log('Woohoo! I love to code! #Techmate'); // This is also a string

        console.log(2011); // This is a number

        console.log(20.49);  // This is also a number
    </script>
