        <h1>Advance Objects | Factory Functions</h1>
        
        <p>
            We have been creating objects individually in previous lessons, but there are times 
            where we want to create many instances of an object quickly. To do this, we need a 
            <code>Factory Function</code>. Picture a real world car manufacturing factory, they
            don't make one car at a time, they make cars by the truckload (thousands). The same 
            concept applies here with JavaScript. <br><br>

            With Factory Function, we can create a function that we return an object that can be
            reused to make multiple object instance. Factory functions can also have parameters 
            allowing us to customize the object that gets returned. <br><br>

            A factory function is simply a special kind of function that returns an object instance.
            It takes some data as its argument and uses it to generate a new object. <br><br>

            Now let's say we run a factory where cars are manufactured, and in this factory, we make
            different types of cars by running a code. Now instead of making each car individually,
            we will use our factory function to make all these cars for us! <br><br>

            Let's see an example:

            <pre>
                const carFactory = (year, horsepower, trim, name) => {
                    return {
                        year: year,
                        horsepower: horsepower,
                        trim: trim,
                        carName() {
                            console.log(name);
                        }
                    }                
                };
                // Creating a Car using the Factory Function
                const myCar = carFactory(2019, '350hp', "Sport", "Toyota Corolla");
                myCar.carName(); // Output: Toyota Corolla
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h3>Output:</h3>

        <script>
            const carFactory = (year, horsepower, trim, name) => {
               return {
                    year: year,
                    horsepower: horsepower,
                    trim: trim,
                    carName() {
                        document.write(name);
                    }
                }                
            };
            // Creating a Car using the Factory Function
            const myCar = carFactory(2019, '350hp', "Sport", "Toyota Corolla");
            myCar.carName(); // Output: Toyota Corolla

        </script>

        <p>        
            Now that we have been able to create <code>myCar</code> object by calling <code>carFactory</code>
            function with parameters for model year, horsepower, trim and name of the car. With this, we don't 
            need to create an object literal anytime we need to create a new car. Instead we can just invoke 
            the factory function and pass in the required arguments to make a car for us. <br><br>    
        
            We can also
            access properties like this:
            <ul>
                <li><code>myCar.year</code>: 2019</li>
                <li><code>myCar.horsepower</code>: 350hp</li>
                <li><code>myCar.trim</code>: Sport</li>
            </ul>
            And call methods like this:
            <ul>
                <li><code>myCar.carName()</code>: This will print "Toyota Corolla" in the output section.</li>            
            </ul>
        </p>

        <!-- <script>
            const monsterFactory = (name, age, energySource, catchPhrase) => {
                return { 
                    name: name,
                    age: age, 
                    energySource: energySource,
                    scare() {
                        console.log(catchPhrase);
                    } 
                }
            };

            const ghost = monsterFactory('Ghouly', 251, 'ectoplasm', 'BOO!');
            ghost.scare(); // 'BOO!'
