        <h1>Advance Objects | Factory Functions</h1>
        
        <p>
            We have been creating objects individually in previous lessons, but there are times 
            where we want to create many instances of an object quickly. To do this, we need a 
            <code>Factory Function</code>. Picture a real world car manufacturing factory, they
            don't make one car at a time, they make cars by the truckload (thousands). The same 
            concept applies here with JavaScript. <br><br>

            With Factory Function, we can create a function that we return an object that can be
            reused to make multiple object instance. Factory functions can also have parameters 
            allowing us to customize the object that gets returned. <br><br>

            A factory function is simply a special kind of function that returns an object instance.
            It takes some data as its argument and uses it to generate a new object. <br><br>

            Now let's say we run a factory where cars are manufactured, and in this factory, we make
            different types of cars by running a code. Now instead of making each car individually,
            we will use our factory function to make all these cars for us! <br><br>

            Let's see an example:

            <pre>
                const carFactory = (year, horsepower, trim, name) => {
                    return {
                        year: year,
                        horsepower: horsepower,
                        trim: trim,
                        carName() {
                            console.log(name);
                        }
                    }                
                };
                // Creating a Car using the Factory Function
                const myCar = carFactory(2019, '350hp', "Sport", "Toyota Corolla");
                myCar.carName(); // Output: Toyota Corolla
            </pre>
        </p>
