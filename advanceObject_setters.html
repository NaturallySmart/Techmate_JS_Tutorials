        <h1>Advance Objects | Setters</h1>

        <p>
            In this lesson we will learn how to use setter methods in JavaScript objects. A set
            method is a special type of method that allows you to modify the properties of an object.
            It takes one parameter which represents the value that should be assigned to the property. <br>

            While the getter method is used to retrieve (get) the value of an object's property, the setter method 
            is used to modify (reassign) the value of an object's property. <br>

            Let's see an illustration:

            <pre>
                const person = {
                    _age: 25,
                    set age(newAge){
                      if (typeof newAge === 'number'){
                        this._age = newAge;
                      } else {
                        console.log('Only numbers are allowed');
                      }
                    }
                  };
            </pre>
