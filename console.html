    <h4>Introduction to Javascript</h4>
    <h1>Console</h1>

    <p>
        The console is a panel that displays important messages, like errors, for developers. <br>
        Much of the work the computer does with our code is invisible to us by default. If we  <br>
        want to see things appear on our screen, we can print, or log, to our console directly. <br> <br>

        In JavaScript, the console keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions, <br>
        that we can use in our code. Keywords are words that are built into the JavaScript language,  <br>
        so the computer recognizes them and treats them specially. <br> <br>

        One action, or method, that is built into the console object is the .log() method. <br>
        When we write console.log() what we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged,  <br>
        to the console. <br> <br>

        It’s going to be very useful for us to print values to the console, so we can see the work  <br>
        that we’re doing.

        This example logs <b>Apple</b> to the console. The quotation mark denotes a string and semicolon <br>
        denotes the end of the line, or statement. Although in JavaScript your code will usually run as <br>
        intended without a semicolon, we recommend learning the habit of ending each statement with a <br>
        semicolon so you never leave one out in the few instances when they are required.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Console.log</b> can be used to print different data types.
    </p>

        The above example logs 44 to the console. You notice there is no quotations as 44 is a number.

    <p><i><b>Note:</b>To view the result of console.log, you have to inspect the web page and go to console</i></p>

        <dt><b>Methods used to display a JavaScript result are:</b></dt>
        <dd>Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().</dd>
        <dd>Writing into the HTML output using document.write().</dd>
        <dd>Writing into the browser console, using console.log().</dd>
        <dd>Writing into an HTML element, using document.getElementById().innerHTML.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        In this tutorial, we will focus more on the <b>Console Method</b> and The 
        <b>document.getElementById().innerHTML.</b>
