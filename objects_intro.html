        <h1>Javascript Objects</h1>

        <p>
            In Javascript, <b>Objects</b> are used to store data in key-value pairs where each value can be 
            of any type including other <b>Objects</b> or arrays. They provide a flexible way to organize and
            access the data. <b>Objects</b> permeates nearly every aspect of JavaScript programming. <br><br>

            in our previous lessons, we have already been exposed to using <b>Objects</b>, knowlingly or 
            unknowlingly. With <b>Objects</b> we open our code to more complex possibilities. We can use 
            JavaScript <b>Objects</b> to model real-world things, like a car, or we can use objects to build 
            the data structures that make the web possible. <br><br>

            Now itâ€™s time to understand the mechanics of objects and start making your own!
