        <h1>Advance Objects | Privacy</h1>

        <p>
            In this lesson we will learn about privacy in JavaScript objects and how to control access to
            object properties using getters and setters. We'll also discuss the concept of encapsulation 
            which is a way of hiding internal implementation details within an object from outside code. <br> <br>

            In JavaScript, accessing and updating object properties are fundametal. However, we sometimes do
            not want other developers to access or update certain object properties, that is, we do not want
            these object properties to be mutable or change in value. <br><br>

            In JavaScript, there is no built-in privacy feature, so as JavaScript developers, we need to
            follow a naming conventions that signal to other developers how to interact with a property. 
            One common convention is to place an underscore <code>_ </code>before the name of a property 
            to mean that the property should not be altered. Hereâ€™s an example of using <code>_</code> to 
            prepend a property.

            <pre>
                const accountDetails = {
                    name: "John Doe",
                    _accountBalance: 50,000
                };
            </pre>
            In the above example, <br>
            - The <code>name</code> property can be accessed by anyone who has access to
            the <code>accountDetails</code> object. <br>
            - The <code>_accountBalance</code> property is private because it
            starts with an underscore and it is not intended to be manipulated. However,
            it can be reassigned as <pre>accountDetails._accountBalance = 2000</pre><br><br>
            
           Let's look at another illustration what the result will print: 

           <pre>
            const car = {
                _horsePower: 250,
                boostPower(){
                    this._horsePower += 75;
            document.write(`Power Boosted! The car now has ${this._horsePower}hp.`)
                }
            };
            //reassigning _horsePower
            car._horsePower = '300hp';

            //calling boosPower on Car
            car.boostPower();
           </pre>
        </p>
