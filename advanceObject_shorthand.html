        <h1>Advance Objects | Property Value Shorthand</h1>

        <p>
            In JavaScript, you can use the shorthand syntax to assign multiple properties at once in an
            object literal. This is known as property value shorthand and it can be referred to as 
            <em>destructuring</em>. It was introduced in ES6. <br><br>

            In our previous lessons, we created a Factory Function that helped us create objects.
            We had to assign each property a key and value even though the key name was the same 
            as the parameter name we assigned to it. Here's a reminder:

            <pre>
                const carFactory = (year, horsepower, trim, name) => {
                    return {
                        year: year,
                        horsepower: horsepower,
                        trim: trim
                    }                
                };
            </pre>
