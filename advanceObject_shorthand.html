        <h1>Advance Objects | Property Value Shorthand</h1>

        <p>
            In JavaScript, you can use the shorthand syntax to assign multiple properties at once in an
            object literal. This is known as property value shorthand and it can be referred to as 
            <em>destructuring</em>. It was introduced in ES6. <br><br>

            In our previous lessons, we created a Factory Function that helped us create objects.
            We had to assign each property a key and value even though the key name was the same 
            as the parameter name we assigned to it. Here's a reminder:

            <pre>
                const carFactory = (year, horsepower, trim, name) => {
                    return {
                        year: year,
                        horsepower: horsepower,
                        trim: trim
                    }                
                };
            </pre>
            
            Imagine if we had to include more properties, that process would quickly become tedious! 
            But we can use a destructuring technique, called property value shorthand, to save 
            ourselves some keystrokes. The example below works exactly like the example above:

            <pre>
                const carFactory = (year, horsepower, trim, name) => {
                    return {
                        year,
                        horsepower,
                        trim
                    }                
                };
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p class="note">
            Notice that we donâ€™t have to repeat ourselves for property assignments!
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's see a full example and check if it works using the code we have used before.
        </p>


        <pre>
            const carFactory = (year, horsepower, trim, name) => {
                return {
                     year,
                     horsepower,
                     trim,
                     carName() {
                         document.write(name);
                     }
                 }                
             };
             // Creating a Car using the Factory Function
             const myCar = carFactory(2019, '350hp', "Sport", "Toyota Corolla");
             myCar.carName(); // Output: Toyota Corolla
        </pre>


        <h3>Output:</h3>
