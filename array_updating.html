    <h1>Updating Elements In an Array</h1>

    <p>
        We have learnt how we can access an element in an array using it's index.
        We can also update an element in an array using the index of that element. <br><br>

        Now let's say you have a list of groceries that you need to purchase in an array,
        and after a while, you decided to change one of the items to another one, how do 
        you do that in array? Letâ€™s see that.

        <pre>
            const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "Mango"];
                //let's say you want to replace banana with grapes
                    fruits[1] = "grapes";
                        console.log(fruits);
            outputs: // ["apple", "grapes", "orange", "Mango"]
        </pre>

        In the above example, we have an array <b>fruits</b> which contains four elements.
        We decided to change banana to grapes by changing the element in index 1 to grapes.
    </p>

    <h2><i>Example 1</i></h2>

    <img src="image/Arrays/array3.PNG" alt="code sample">

    <p id="example1"></p>

    <script>
        const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "Mango"];
        fruits[1] = "grapes";
        document.getElementById("example1").innerHTML = fruits;
    </script>


    <h1>Arrays with let and const</h1>

    <p>
        Previously, you must have learnt that variables can be declared using keywords
        such as <b>const</b> and <b>let</b>, and that variables declared with <b>const</b>
        cannot be redeclared but those declared with <b>let</b> can be redeclared. <br><br>

        However, in array you can can change the content of a <b>const </b>array, but cannot reassign 
        a new array or a different value. But you can change the content of a <b>let </b>array and also
        reassign the value. <br><br>

        <b>See example below:</b>
    </p>

    <h2><i>Example 2</i></h2>

    <p>See Output below</p>

    <img src="image/Arrays/arrays5.PNG" alt="console error">

    <script>

        let fruitNames = ['Apple', 'Mango', 'Banana', 'Orange']

        const cars = ['Ford', 'Toyota', 'BMW', 'Audi'];

        fruitNames[0] = 'Grapes';

        console.log(fruitNames); //prints the array and update the index

        fruitNames = ['Grapes']; //reassign fruitNames to Grapes as an array
        console.log(fruitNames); // prints Grapes

        cars[3] = 'Honda'; 

        console.log(cars); // prints the array nd updates the index of [3]

       cars = ['Honda']; // tried to reassign cars to another array
        console.log(cars); // throws up an error
    </script>
