        <h1>Object Methods</h1>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, objects can have their own methods which are functions that belong to 
            the object and can be called on it. These methods can perform a
            variety of tasks such as calculating values or modifying properties. <br><br>

            When the data stored on an object is a function we call that a <code>method</code>. 
            A property is what an object has, while a method is what an object does. <br><br>

            We are already familiar with Methods of some sort as we have been using it all along.
            For example: when you use the Math Object's <code>Math.sqrt()</code>,
            <code>Math.max()</code>, <code>Math.min()</code>, etc., these are all methods.
            Here, <code>Math</code> is  global JavaScript Object while <code>.sqrt()</code>,
            <code>.max()</code> and <code>.min()</code> are methods on it. <code>Console</code>
            is also a global Object in JavaScript while <code>.log()</code> is a method on that
            object. <br><br>

            We can include methods in our object literals by creating ordinary, colon-separated 
            key-value pairs. The key serves as our method’s name, while the value is an anonymous 
            function expression (or any other type of function). This allows us to create custom
            methods for our objects. <br><br>

            Let's see how this works!
    
            <pre>
                const car = {
                    mycarDesc: function() {
                        console.log('My car is a red Toyota Camry with a 
                        5 speed auto transmission. I bought the car from
                        a friend who was moving away');
                    }
                };
            </pre>
       
            With the new method syntax introduced in ES6 we can omit the colon and the function keyword.
            So the above will look like this.

            <pre>
                const car = {
                    mycarDesc() {
                        console.log('My car is a red Toyota Camry with a
                        5 speed auto transmission. I bought the car from
                        a friend who was moving away');
                    }
                };
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h2>Invoking Object Method</h2>

        <p>
            Object methods are invoked by appending the object’s name with the dot operator followed 
            by the method name and parentheses:

            <pre>
                car.mycarDesc(); // Prints:
                'My car is a red Toyota Camry with a 5 speed auto transmission. 
                I bought the car from a friend who was moving away'.
            </pre>
        </p>
