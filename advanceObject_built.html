        <h1>Advance Objects | Built-in Object Methods</h1>

        <p>
            In the previous exercises we’ve been creating instances of objects that have their 
            own methods. But, we can also take advantage of built-in methods for Objects! <br><br>

            For example, we have access to object instance methods like: <code>.hasOwnProperty()</code>, 
            <code>.valueOf()</code>, and many more! <br><br>

            There are also useful Object class methods such as <code>Object.assign()</code>, 
            <code>Object.entries()</code>, and <code>Object.keys()</code> just to name a few. 
            For a comprehensive list, browse: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#Methods">
            MDN’s object instance documentation.</a> <br><br>
            
            
            Practice your documentation reading skills!!!
