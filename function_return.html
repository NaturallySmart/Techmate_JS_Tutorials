    <h1>Return</h1>

    <p>
        When a function is called, the computer will run through the functionâ€™s code and evaluate the 
        result of calling the function. By default that resulting value is <i>undefined</i>. 
        The <b>Return Keyword</b>, is used to capture the result of a function. <br><br>
        
        
        Functions return (pass back) values using the return keyword. return ends function execution and 
        returns the specified value to the location where it was called. <br><br>
        
        When you forget to use the return keyword, the function will return undefined by default.
    </p>

    <h2><i>Example 1</i></h2>

    <p>
        TechMate coding school just opened it's physical training centre and needs to buy computers to fill
        the class for all students. The students desk has been arranged and it has 6 rows and 5 columns.
        Determine how many computers <b>TechMate</b> needs to buy to fill all the desk using a function 
        return statement.
    </p>

    <p id="example1"></p>

    <script>

        function deskCount(rows, columns) {
            return rows * columns;
        }

        const computersNeeded = deskCount(6, 5);

        document.getElementById('example1').innerHTML = computersNeeded;
       
    </script>

    <h1>Helper Functions</h1>

    <p>
        We can also use the return value of a function inside another function. These functions being 
        called within another function are often referred to as <b><i>helper functions</i></b>. Since each function 
        is carrying out a specific task, it makes our code easier to read and debug if necessary. <br><br>

        We can use functions to section off small bits of logic or tasks, then use them when we need to. 
        Writing helper functions can help take large and difficult tasks and break them into smaller and 
        more manageable tasks.

        <b>See Code sample below</b>
    </p>

    <img src="image/functions/function6.PNG" alt="code sample"> <br>

    <script>
        function multiplyByNineFifths(number) {
        return number * (9/5);
        };

        function getFahrenheit(celsius) {
        return multiplyByNineFifths(celsius) + 32;
        };

        getFahrenheit(15); // Returns 59
    </script>

    <h3>In the example above:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>getFahrenheit()</b> is called and 15 is passed as an argument.
        </li>
        <li>
            The code block inside of getFahrenheit() calls multiplyByNineFifths() and passes 15 as an argument.
        </li>
        <li>
            multiplyByNineFifths() takes the argument of 15 for the number parameter.
        </li>
        <li>
            The code block inside of multiplyByNineFifths() function multiplies 15 by (9/5), which evaluates to 27.
        </li>
        <li>
            27 is returned back to the function call in getFahrenheit().
        </li>
        <li>
            getFahrenheit() continues to execute. It adds 32 to 27, which evaluates to 59.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, 59 is returned back to the function call getFahrenheit(15).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><i>Exercise</i></h2>

    <p>
        TechMate coding school just opened it's physical training centre and needs to buy computers to fill
        the class for all students. The students desk has been arranged and it has 6 rows and 5 columns.
        Now they need a program that can calculate how much is needed to buy computers for all the desks, 
        given that the price by unit of computer is N120,000. <br>

        <b>Hints:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Save the total cost to a variable called totalCost using the <b>const keyword</b></li>
            <li>use the cost per computer unit as 120000 (a number)</li>
        </ul>


    </p>    

    <script>
        function deskCount(rows, columns) {
        return rows * columns;
        }

        function costOfComputers(rows, columns) {
        return deskCount(rows, columns) * 120000;
        }

        const totalCost = costOfComputers(6, 5);

        console.log(totalCost);
