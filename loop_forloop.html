        <h1>The For Loop</h1>

        <p>
            Instead of writing out the same code over and over, loops allow us to tell computers 
            to repeat a given block of code on its own. One way to give computers these instructions 
            is with a <b>for loop</b>. <br><br>

            The typical for loop includes an <b>iterator variable</b> that usually appears in all three 
            expressions. The iterator variable is initialized, checked against the stopping condition, 
            and assigned a new value on each loop iteration. Iterator variables can have any name, 
            but it’s best practice to use a descriptive variable name. <br><br>

            A <b>for loop</b> contains three expressions separated by a semi-colon (;) inside the parentheses:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Initialization - This expression sets up the starting point or state of the loop. 
                    It's executed once before the loop begins and can also be used to declare the 
                    iterator variable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Condition - This expression determines whether the loop should continue executing.
                    If the condition evaluates as true, then the loop continues; if it evaluates to 
                    false, the loop ends.
                </li>
                <li>
                    an iteration statement is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <b>The for loop syntax looks like this:</b>

            <pre>
              
                for (let counter = 0; counter &lt; 5; counter++) {
                    console.log(counter);
                }
                
                In the above example, the output will be:
                    0
                    1
                    2
                    3
                    4
            </pre>

            <b>Example explained:</b>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    We start by declaring our iterator variable "counter" and setting it equal to zero
                    <i>(let counter = 0)</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next we set the condition for when the loop should stop. Our condition checks
                    if the current value of "counter" is less than five <i>(counter &lt; 5)</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, we increment the value of "counter" by one with each loop iteration
                    using the post-increment operator ++ <i>(counter++)</i>. The result of the expression
                    after the semicolon is returned, so in this case, it returns the original value
                    of "counter".
                </li>
                <li>
                    The code block is inside of the curly braces, console.log(counter), will execute 
                    until the condition evaluates to false. The condition will be false when counter 
                    is greater than or equal to 5 — the point that the condition becomes false is 
                    sometimes called the stop condition.
                </li>
            </ul>

            This <b>for loop</b> makes it possible to write 0, 1, 2, and 3 programmatically.
        </p>

        <h2><i>Example 1</i></h2>

        <img src="image/loop/loop2.PNG" alt="code sample">

        <p id="example1"></p>

        <script>
            for (let counter = 11; counter < 16; counter++){
                document.getElementById("example1").innerHTML += "<br>" + counter;
            }
        </script>
      

      <h2>Looping in Reverse</h2>
      <p>
            In the above example, the loop runs from 11 to 15. How about if we want it to count
            backward from 15 down to 11? <br><br>

            To run a backward for loop, we must:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Set the iterator variable to the highest desired value in the initialization expression.
                    <i>(let counter = 15)</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Specify the condition for ending the loop as an inequality test against the lowest
                    desired value.
                    <i>(counter >= 11)</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use a decrement operator -- instead of an increment operator ++.
                    <i>(--counter)</i>                    
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            Here's an example:
        </p>

        <h2><i>Example 2</i></h2>

        <img src="image/loop/loop3.PNG" alt="code sample">

        <p id="example2"></p>

        <script>
            for(let counter = 15; counter >= 11; counter--) {
                document.getElementById("example2").innerHTML += '<br>' + counter;
            }
        </script>

            <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>
                When writing/changing loops, there is a chance that our stopping condition 
                isn’t met and we get a dreaded infinite loop which essentially stops our 
                programming from running anything else! To exit out of an infinite loop in 
                an exercise, refresh the page - then fix the code for your loop.
