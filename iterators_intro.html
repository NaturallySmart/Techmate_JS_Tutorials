        <h1>Introduction to Iterators</h1>

        <p>
            An <b>iterator</b> is an object that allows you to traverse through a collection of elements 
            in a container like array or list. <br><br>

            Let's say you had a grocery list and you wanted to know what each item on the list was. Youâ€™d 
            have to scan through each row and check for the item. This common task is similar to what we 
            have to do when we want to iterate over, or loop through, an array. One tool at our disposal 
            is the for loop. However, we also have access to built-in array methods which make looping 
            easier:  <br><br>
            
            <b>forEach(), map(), filter() and reduce()</b>. These are called higher order functions 
            because they take other functions as arguments (or return them). They can be used with any 
            function that takes one argument. In this case, it will be the callback function. The iterator 
            method is not part of JavaScript itself; rather, it comes from the Array prototype. It returns 
            an iterator object that contains two properties: next() and value(). We use these two properties 
            together to get all the values out of the array. <br><br>

            <b>illustration</b>

            <pre>
                const cars = ['Toyota', 'Volvo', 'Audi', 'Honda'];

                    cars.forEach(cars => {
                    console.log(cars + ' is one of my favorite cars.');
                });

                const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

                    const squareNumbers = numbers.map(number => {
                    return number * number;
                });

                console.log(squareNumbers);

                const mixedArray = ['laptop', 3, 8, 'phone', 57.78, 120, 'wifi'];

                const onlyNumbers = mixedArray.filter(mixedArray => {
                  return typeof mixedArray === 'number';
                });
                
                console.log(onlyNumbers);
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h3><i>Output:</i></h3>

        <pre>
            Toyota is one of my favorite cars.
            Volvo is one of my favorite cars.
            Audi is one of my favorite cars.
            Honda is one of my favorite cars.
            [ 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ]
            [ 3, 8, 57.78, 120 ]
