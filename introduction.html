    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT</h1>
    
    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that enables you to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p>

    <p>
        JavaScript is primarily known as the language of most modern web browsers,<br>
        and its early quirks gave it a bit of a bad reputation. However, the language <br>
        has continued to evolve and improve. JavaScript is a powerful, flexible, and fast<br> 
        programming language now being used for increasingly complex web development and beyond! <br> <br><br>

        Since JavaScript remains at the core of web development, it’s often the first language learned<br>
        by self-taught coders eager to learn and build. We’re excited for what you’ll be able to create <br>
        with the JavaScript foundation you gain here. JavaScript powers the dynamic behavior on most <br>
        websites, including this one.<br><br><br>

        In this lesson, you will learn introductory coding concepts including <a href="datatypes.html">data types </a>and built-in <br>
        objects—essential knowledge for all aspiring developers. Make sure to take notes and pace yourself.<br>
        This foundation will set you up for understanding the more complex concepts you’ll encounter later.
