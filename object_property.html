        <h1>Object Property Assignment</h1>

        <p>
            In JavaScript, objects are collections of properties and each property has a key (name) 
            associated with a value. Objects are mutable meaning we can update them after we create them! <br><br>

            We can use either dot notation, <code>.</code>, or bracket notation, <code>[]</code>, and the assignment 
            operator, <code>=</code> to add new key-value pairs to an object or change an existing property. <br><br>

            See the Illustration below:

            <pre>
                Car {'Fuel Type'} = 'Petrol';
                car.make = 'Toyota';
            </pre>

            In the above Illustration:

            <li>
                The first line is an example of Object Property assignment where we assign value to 
                <code>Fuel type</code> as <code>Petrol</code> using the <code>bracket notation</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The second line is an example of Object Property assignment where we assign value to 
                <code>make</code> as <code>Toyota</code> using the <code>dot notation</code>.
            </li>


            One of two things can happen with property assignment:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the object does not have that property then it will be created for you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the object already contains that property then its existing value will be 
                    replaced by new one.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="note">
            <b>Note:</b>
            It’s important to know that although we can’t reassign an object declared with <code>const</code>, 
            we can still mutate it, meaning we can add new properties and change the properties that are there.            </p>
        </p>

        <h2>Illustration</h2>

        <pre>
            const car = {make: 'Toyota'};
            car = {make: 'Toyota'}; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
            car.make = 'Honda'; // Changes the value of the make property.

            car.color = 'Red'; // Create a new key of 'color' with a value of 'red'
        </pre>

        <p>You can delete a property from an object with the delete operator.</p>

        <pre>
            const car = {
                make: 'Toyota';
                color: 'red';
                'Fuel Type': 'Petrol';
                owner: 'Ray Jones';
            }

            delete car.color; // removes the color property
        </pre>

        <script>
            let spaceship = {
            'Fuel Type' : 'Turbo Fuel',
            homePlanet : 'Earth',
            color: 'silver',
            'Secret Mission' : 'Discover life outside of Earth.'
            };

            // Write your code below
            spaceship.color = 'glorious gold';
            spaceship.numEngines = 7;

            delete spaceship['Secret Mission'];
        </script>
