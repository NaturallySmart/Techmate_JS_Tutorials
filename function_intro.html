    <h1>FUNCTIONS</h1>

    <h3>What are Functions?</h3>

    <p>
        A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. <br><br>

        A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it). The result of the execution
        can be returned back as output or used elsewhere in your program. <br><br>

        When coding, we often wants to use a code to perform a specific task multiple times. So instead of writing
        that code block again, we can save it in a function, and just re-use the function each time we want to 
        perform that task. This makes our code more easy to read and maintain. <br><br>

        In this lesson, we will learn how to use a function to get a better and concise code.
