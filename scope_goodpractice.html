    <h1>Practice Good Scoping</h1>

    <p>
        In programming, practicing good scoping is a key concept to avoid variable conflicts and unexpected 
        behavior in your code. <br><br>

        This will greatly improve your code in several ways:

        <li>
            It will make your code more legible since the blocks will organize your code into discrete sections.
        </li>
        <li>
            It makes your code more understandable since it clarifies which variables are associated with 
            different parts of the program rather than having to keep track of them line after line!
        </li>
        <li>
            It’s easier to maintain your code, since your code will be modular.
        </li>
        <li>
            It will save memory in your code because it will cease to exist after the block finishes running.
        </li>
        <li>
            It helps you keep track of the variables that are available within each function or block of code.
        </li>

        <pre>
            const logSkyColor = () => {
                const dusk = true;
                let color = 'blue'; 
                if (dusk) {
                    let color = 'pink';
                    console.log(color); // prints pink
                    } 
                    console.log(color); // Prints "blue"
                    };

            console.log(color); // throws a ReferenceError                   
        </pre>

        In the above illustration, you will notice the following:

        <li>
            We create a variable color inside the <b><i>logSkyColor()</i></b> function.
        </li>
        <li>
            After the if statement, we define a new code block with the {} braces. Here 
            we assign a new value to the variable color if the if statement is truthy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Within the if block, the color variable holds the value 'pink', though outside 
            the if block, in the function body, the color variable holds the value 'blue'.
        </li>
        <li>
            On the last line, we attempt to print the value of color outside both the if 
            statement and the definition of logSkyColor(). This will throw a ReferenceError 
            since color only exists within the scope of those two blocks — it is never 
            defined in the global scope.
        </li>
        <li>
            While we use block scope, we still pollute our namespace by reusing the same 
            variable name twice. A better practice would be to rename the variable inside 
            the block.
        </li> <br><br>

        Block scope is a powerful tool in JavaScript, since it allows us to define variables 
        with precision, and not pollute the global namespace. If a variable does not need to 
        exist outside a block— it shouldn’t!
