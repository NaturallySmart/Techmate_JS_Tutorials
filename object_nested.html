        <h1>Nested Objects</h1>

        <p>
            Most times, an object are often nested. That is, objects might have another 
            object as a property which in turn could have a property that might be an 
            array of other objects and so on. This can get pretty complex and it's
            important to know how to handle these situations. <br><br>

            In JavaScript, we use the dot notation (.) to access properties of
            nested objects. For example:
            <pre>
                const person = {
                    firstName: "John",
                    lastName: "Doe",
                    age: 32,
                    address: {
                        streetAddress: "4567 Main St.",
                        city: "New York City",
                        state: "NY",
                        zipCode: "10001"
                        }
                        };
                console.log(person.address); // Output: {streetAddress: 
                "4567 Main St.", city: "New York City", state: "NY", zipCode: 
                "10001"}
                   
                    
            </pre>

            We can chain operators to access nested properties. Weâ€™ll have to pay attention to which 
            operator makes sense to use in each layer. It can be helpful to pretend you are the computer 
            and evaluate each expression from left to right so that each operation starts to feel a little 
            more manageable.
