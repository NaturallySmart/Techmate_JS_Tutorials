        <h1>Advance Objects | Using this Keyword in Arrow functions</h1>

        <p>
            In JavaScript, arrow functions do not have their own "this" keyword.
            The value of "this" is determined by where the function is called from.
            If you are inside an object method then "this" will refer to that object.
            But if you use an arrow function outside of any object or method,
            "this" will be equal to the global object (usually window). <br>

            It is very important to avoid using <code>arrow functions</code> when using <code>this</code>
            in a method.

            <pre>            
                const car = {
                    Make: 'Toyota',
                    Model: 'Camry',
                    Year: 2019,
                    Color: 'Blue',
                    power: '203hp',
                        getCarDetails:() => {
                        return `This ${this.Make} ${this.Model} has a ${this.
                        power} and was made in ${this.Year}.`;
                    },
                };

                console.log(`${car.getCarDetails()}`)  //Outputs undefined
