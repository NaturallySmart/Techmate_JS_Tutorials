        <h1>Looping Through Objects</h1>

        <p>
            In JavaScript, you can use a loop to iterate over the properties of an object and perform operations
            using a <code>for...in</code> statement. <br>
            <code>Loops</code> are programming tools that repeat a block of code until a condition is met. <br>
            We have previously learnt how to loop through arrays. <br>
            <code>For...in</code> will execute a given block of code for each property in an object.
        </p>

<p>
    In the above code, <br>

    1. We have created an object named `business` which contains another object called `team`.
       This nested object represents our team members along with their details like names and skills.
    <br>
    2. We used the for in loop to Iterate over each member of the `team` object using the variable 
    `teamMembers`. Inside this loop, we can access properties of `business.team[teamMembers]` 
    such as `business.team[teamMembers].name`, `business.team[teamMembers].skills`, etc.
