        <h1>Looping Through Arrays</h1>

        <p>
            In this lesson we will be learning about looping through arrays in JavaScript and how to 
            use the for loop statement to iterate over each element of an array. <b>for loops</b> are 
            very handy for iterating over data structures. <br><br>

            For example, we can use a <b>for loop</b> to perform the same operation on each element 
            on an array. Arrays hold lists of data, like customer names or product information. <br><br>            

            Imagine we owned a store and wanted to increase the price of every product in our catalog. 
            That could be a lot of repeating code, but by using a for loop to iterate through the array 
            we could accomplish this task easily. <br><br>

            To loop through each element in an array, a <b>for loop</b> should use the array’s
            <b>.length</b> property in its condition. <br><br>

            Check out the example below to see how <b>for loops</b> iterate on arrays:

            <pre>
                const products = ["Golden Morn", "Chocolate", "Bags of rice"];

                for (let i = 0; i < products.lenght; i++) {
                    console.log(products[i]); 
                    // Output: Golden Morn Chocolate Bags of rice
                }
            </pre>

            In the loop above, we’ve named our iterator variable <b>i</b>. This is a variable 
            naming convention you’ll see in a lot of loops. When we use <b>i</b> to iterate 
            through arrays we can think of it as being short-hand for the word index. Notice 
            how our stopping condition checks that <b>i</b> is less than <b>products.length</b>. 
            Remember that arrays are zero-indexed, the index of the last element of an array is 
            equivalent to the length of that array minus 1. If we tried to access an element at 
            the index of <b>products.length</b> we will have gone too far! <br><br>

            With <b>for loops</b>, it’s easier for us to work with elements in arrays.

        <h2><i>Example 1</i></h2>

        <img src="image/loop/loop4.PNG" alt="code sample">

        <p id="example1"></p>

        <script>
            const products = ["Golden Morn", "Chocolate", "Bags of rice"];
        
            for (let i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {

                document.getElementById("example1").innerHTML += "<br>" + products[i];

                //document.getElementById("example1").innerHTML += `I just bought ${products[i]} from MetroShop<br> `;

                //document.getElementById("example1").innerHTML += "<br>" + 'I bought ' + products[i] + ' from MetroHub';
               
            }
        </script>

        <h2><i>Exercise</i></h2>

        <p>
            In the example given, re-write the code to include: <i>I bought <b>PRODUCT</b> from metrohub</i>
            when printed.
