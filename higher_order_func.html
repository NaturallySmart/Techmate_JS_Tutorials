        <h1>HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            We often give instructions to people on what to do. Take for instance you tell
            someone to help you do laundry. Instead of telling the person to take out your
            dirty clothes, get water, get soap, wash the clothes etc, you can sum all of
            this up into one instruction: "Wash my clothes". This is a <b>higher order function</b>. <br>
            
            Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions as arguments or return 
            them as results. They allow us to create more complex programs by allowing us to build
            smaller parts and then combine those parts together in different ways. <br><br>
            
            In this lesson, we’ll learn how to use “abstraction” in programming by writing functions. 
            In addition to allowing us to reuse our code, functions help to make clear, readable programs. 
            If you encounter countToThree() in a program, you might be able to quickly guess what the 
            function does without having to stop and read the function’s body. <br><br>

            We’re also going to learn about a way to add another level of abstraction to our 
            programming: higher-order functions. Higher-order functions are functions that accept 
            other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output. This enables us to 
            build abstractions on other abstractions, just like “We hosted a birthday party” is 
            an abstraction that may build on the abstraction “We made a cake.”
