        <h3>HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS</h3>

        <h1>Functions as Data</h1>

        <p>
            We may be faced with some seemly annoying long function names that may make 
            our code harder to read and understand. To solve this problem we can use higher 
            order functions in JavaScript. <br><br>

            See Example below:

            <pre>
                const announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork = ( ) => {
                    console.log( "I am doing some important work!" );
                }
            </pre>

            Imagine that we have to use the above function several times in our code, it may 
            become frustrating because the function name is too long. So what do we do? We can 
            create a variable that holds the function so instead of writing the whole function
            every time we just need to call the variable! <br><br>

            So we can rename the function without losing the source code and re-assign the function 
            to a variable with a shorter name.

            <pre>
                    const busy = announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork;

                    busy();
            </pre>

            <b>busy</b> is a variable that holds a reference to our original function. If we could look 
            up the address in memory of busy and the address in memory of <b>announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork</b> 
            they would point to the same place. Our new <b>busy()</b> function can be invoked with parentheses 
            as if that was the name we originally gave our function. <br><br>

            Notice how we assign <b>announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork</b> without parentheses as the value to 
            the busy variable. We want to assign the value of the function itself, not the value it returns
            when invoked. <br> <br>

            In JavaScript, functions are <i>first class objects</i>. This means that, like other objects youâ€™ve 
            encountered, JavaScript functions can have properties such as length, names etc and methods such
            as <i>toString</i> etc.
        </p>

            const checkFourPlusFourEqualsEightAThousandTimes = () => {
                for(let i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
                    if((4 + 4) != 8) {
                        //console.log('Something went wrong!');
                        document.getElementById('example1').innerHTML = "Something went wrong!";
                    }
                }
            }
            //reassigning the function

            const isFourPlusFour = checkFourPlusFourEqualsEightAThousandTimes;

            isFourPlusFour(); //calling the function
            //using the name property to call the name of the original function
            console.log(isFourPlusFour.name); 

            document.getElementById('example1').innerHTML = isFourPlusFour.name;
