        <h1>Advance Objects | The this Keyword</h1>

        <p>
            In JavaScript, the "this" keyword is a special variable that refers to an object. It
            holds the reference of the current object and allows access to its properties and methods.
            When we use it inside a method or function, it represents the owner of that method or
            function. <br>

            See an Illustration below:

            <pre>
                const car = {
                    Make: 'Toyota',
                    Model: 'Camry',
                    Year: 2019,
                    Color: 'Blue',
                    power: '203hp',
                    getCarDetails() {
                        return `This ${this.Make} ${this.Model} has a ${this.
                            power} and was made in ${this.Year}.`;
                        },
                };
                console.log(`${car.getCarDetails()}`)
                

            </pre>

            <h3>Output:</h3>
        </p>

        <script>
            const car = {
                Make: 'Toyota',
                Model: 'Camry',
                Year: 2019,
                Color: 'Blue',
                power: '203hp',
                getCarDetails() {
                    return `This ${this.Make} ${this.Model} has a ${this.
                        power} and was made in ${this.Year}.`;
                    },
            };
            document.write(`${car.getCarDetails()}`)
        </script>

        <p>
            In the above example we used this keyword to,
            refer to properties of the object "car". The method "getCarDetails()" is called on
            the "car" object using parentheses after its name. This allows us to access the function as
            if it were a property of the object. Inside the function, "this" refers to the
            "car" object itself. So, "this.Make", "this.power" etc are accessing the properties of the 
            "car" object. Then we used <code>String Interpolation</code> to return all the properties we 
            want to output.
